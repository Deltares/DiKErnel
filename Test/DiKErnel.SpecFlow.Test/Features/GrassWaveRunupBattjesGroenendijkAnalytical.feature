        When I run the grass wave run-up Battjes-Groenendijk analytical calculation

        And the rounded time of failure is -5604

    Scenario: Robustness edge case
    Remark: The time step 36000 - 43200 results in a 0 for the representative wave run-up (2 percent).
    This results in a division by zero due to the wave run-up transition and the wave run-up root mean square being
    both 0. Therefore, no result will be produced by the DiKErnel (NaN).
